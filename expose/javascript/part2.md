A. student.name\
B. student['Grad Year']\
C. student.greeting();\
D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name\
E. student.courseLoad[0]\
A. 32, since + in JS works for number addition and concatenated. Here first element is '3' so, it will concat 2 to '3'\
B. 1, - will produce their difference\
C. 3, null to number value is 0\
D. 3null , null in "" + null is string null.\
E. 4, true to number value is 1\
F. 0, false and null tonumber value are both 0.\
G.  3undefined, undefined is string 'undefined' when "" + undefined\
H. NaN undefined does not have a number value.\
A. True, since 2 is greater than 1, and JS will convert '2' to 2 when do comparison with int 1.\
B. False, since alphabetically, '1' of '12' is less than '2'\
C. True, when JS will convert '2' to 2 when do comparison with int 2.\
D. False, since === will check data type, 2 and '2' are not same data type\
E. False, since true tonumber value is 1.\
F. True, since Boolean(2) returns true. Boolean() will return true for non-zero number.\
They both are comparison operator,== just check the equality of 2 operands however === will consider the data type of 2 operands. === will return true if both operands have same data type and values.
